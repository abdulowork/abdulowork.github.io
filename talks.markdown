{% include linked-heading.html heading="Writing native iOS tests is hard? Running them is even harder! - 2022.07.04" level=2 %}

At Avito, we employed an in-house solution [Emcee](https://github.com/avito-tech/Emcee) for distributing a large suite of iOS tests. Here I discuss the challenges of building your own distributed test runner and give a demo showing how you can quickly hit the ground running with Emcee today.
