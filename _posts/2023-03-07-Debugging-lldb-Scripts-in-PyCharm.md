Debugging in `lldb` can be great. But sometimes, running commands manually becomes tedious. Fortunately, `lldb` provides a way to automate any action: **Python scripts!**

However, writing `Python` scripts without IDE support and a debugger is beneath any developer's dignity. In this tutorial, I will show you how to set up `PyCharm` to take your `lldb` scripting experience to the next level. There will be:

* `Python` and `PyCharm` setup for `lldb` scripting
* `PyCharm` fix for process attachment on an `arm64` macOS
* `Python` modules injection for IDE and runtime support
* Debugging breakpoints and commands in `PyCharm`

{% include linked-heading.html heading="Setting up PyCharm" level=2 %}

Let's start by creating a directory for the project:

```bash
$ mkdir lldb_scripts && cd lldb_scripts
```

Now we need a python environment. Create a virtual environment from the Xcode's embedded Python used by the lldb:

```bash
$ sh -c 'exec "$(xcode-select -p)"/Library/Frameworks/Python3.framework/Versions/Current/bin/python3 -m venv python_env'
```

We also need lldb's initialization file, so might as well link it to the project:

```bash
$ touch ~/.lldbinit && ln -s ~/.lldbinit lldbinit
```

Open the project in PyCharm. I am on a community edition:

```bash
$ open -a "PyCharm CE" .
```

Go to project settings and make sure the project picked up the correct virtual environment from the `python_env` directory:

{% include linked-heading.html heading="Script to debug" level=2 %}

Now we need a script to debug. Make a `test.py` file with the following contents:

```python
import os  
import time  
  
def test_loop(debugger, command, result, dict):  
    print(f'lldb pid is: {os.getpid()}')  
    while True:  
        time.sleep(3)  
        print(f'The time is: {time.time()}')  
  
def __lldb_init_module(debugger, dict):  
    module = os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(__file__))[0]  
    function = test_loop.__name__  
    print(f'\nRegistering {module}.{function}. Call "{function}" from lldb to run the script')  
    debugger.HandleCommand(f'command script add -f {module}.{function} {function}')
    print(f'\nAttach to lldb at: {os.getpid()}')
```

And add the script import to the `.lldbinit` file:

```
command script import ~/lldb_scripts/test.py
```

The script is pretty simple:
1. `__lldb_init_module` function is called when lldb is loaded
2. The function registers the `test_loop` command in lldb
3. Calling `test_loop` prints lldb's pid and spins in an eternal loop printing time every 3 seconds

Start `lldb` and call the `test_loop`:

```bash
$ lldb -o test_loop
```

Hopefully, this is your output:

{% include linked-heading.html heading="Attaching PyCharm to the script" level=2 %}

As always, things aren't as simple as just running `Attach To Process` in PyCharm. `lldb` is signed to run with a hardened runtime, which means PyCharm won't be able to attach. We need a copy of `lldb` with a stripped-down signature to bypass this restriction. Let's make one:

```bash
$ cp "$(xcrun -f lldb)" unsigned_lldb && codesign --force --sign - unsigned_lldb
```

If you made the copy outside the Xcode's `bin` directory, the rpath would be incorrect. To run this `lldb`, we must specify rpath explicitly. Run `lldb` again using:

```bash
$ DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH="$(dirname $(xcode-select -p))/SharedFrameworks" ./unsigned_lldb -o test_loop
```

![lldb_output_2](/assets/3/lldb_output_2.png)

To attach PyCharm, go to `Run -> Attach To Process...` and select the pid of the lldb process (i.e., `5203` from the output above).

If PyCharm doesn't show any processes go to `PyCharm -> Preferences... -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Python Debugger` and set the `Attach To Process` filter string to empty so that all processes are displayed.

On an Intel machine (or an `arch -x86_64 lldb`) PyCharm should attach and start outputting the timer in the debugger console. But many of us no longer work on Intel machines; on an arm machine, PyCharm will fail to attach.

{% include linked-heading.html heading="Fixing a broken arm" level=2 %}

Attaching to arm targets, as of PyCharm 2022.3.2, [isn't supported](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-51483/Python-debugger-fails-to-launch-on-Mac-M1-Monterey-for-FastAPI-project-with-pyenv-interpreter#focus=Comments-27-6474114.0-0) out of the box. Fortunately, the issue is [relatively easy to workaround](https://github.com/fabioz/PyDev.Debugger/pull/201).

When PyCharm connects to a process, it injects and calls a library with a C function that links the debugger to the debuggee. PyCharm bundles only the x86_64 version of that library and, on attachment, futilely tries to inject the library into an arm process.

To fix the attachment process, we need to compile the library to run on arm and preload it into `lldb` before PyCharm tries to call the C function from the library. The sources for the library are shipped with PyCharm and can be found in:

```bash
$ cd "/Applications/PyCharm CE.app/Contents/plugins/python-ce/helpers/pydev/pydevd_attach_to_process/linux_and_mac"
```

A glance at `compile_mac.sh` reveals we need to substitute x86_64 for arm64, which should be enough to compile the library. Let's compile and link:

```bash
g++ -fPIC -D_REENTRANT -std=c++11 -arch arm64 -c -o attach_arm64.o attach.cpp
g++ -dynamiclib -nostartfiles -arch arm64 -o attach_arm64.dylib attach_arm64.o -lc
```

We will use `dlopen` to preload the library straight from the `test.py` script. Add the following lines (make sure the dylib path matches your path):

```python
import _ctypes  
import platform
import os
  
def load_pydevd_library():  
    processor = platform.processor()  
    if processor != 'arm':  
        print(f'lldb is running {processor} arch, skipping the arm fix')  
        return  
  
    library_handle = _ctypes.dlopen(  
        '/Applications/PyCharm CE.app/Contents/plugins/python-ce/helpers/pydev/pydevd_attach_to_process/linux_and_mac/attach_arm64.dylib',  
        os.RTLD_NOW  
    )  
    if library_handle == 0:  
        print("Library didn't load")  
        return  
    print(f"Library handle is {hex(library_handle)}")  
  
    function = 'DoAttach'  
    do_attach_address = _ctypes.dlsym(library_handle, function)  
    if do_attach_address == 0:  
        print(f"Couldn't find {function} in library at {library_handle}")  
        return  
    print(f"{function} loaded at {hex(do_attach_address)}")  
  
load_pydevd_library()
```

If you now run `lldb`, the library handle and the `DoAttach` function address will print out:

![lldb_output_3](/assets/3/lldb_output_3.png)

And attaching in PyCharm should finally work as expected:

![pycharm_1](/assets/3/pycharm_1.png)

PyCharm still tries to inject the Intel library, but everything works out since we preloaded the `DoAttach` function.

{% include linked-heading.html heading="Waiting for the debugger" level=2 %}

Now that all platforms are attachable, we need a way to stop at the section we want to debug. `pydevd.settrace()` is the call we are seeking.

However, the issue is that neither the project in PyCharm, where we work on the script, nor lldb, where the script executes, know anything about `pydevd` APIs. If we stick `import pydevd` into the script, nothing works:

![lldb_output_4](/assets/3/lldb_output_4.png)

Let's first fix the lldb runtime. On my `PyCharm CE` pydevd is located in:

```
/Applications/PyCharm CE.app/Contents/plugins/python-ce/helpers/pydev
```

To make the `pydevd` module accessible to the lldb runtime, we need to add this directory to the python module search paths using the  `sys.path` API. Try adding the following lines at the beginning of `test.py`:

![lldb_output_4](/assets/3/pydevd.png)

The `lldb -o test_loop` command is working again!

Now we need to make PyCharm aware of the API. One way to do that is to create a `pth` pointer in the `site-packages`:

```bash
$ echo '/Applications/PyCharm CE.app/Contents/plugins/python-ce/helpers/pydev' > "$(echo python_env/lib/python*)/site-packages/pydev.pth"
```

Since we will be writing scripts for lldb, let's also pull in the lldb API:

```bash
$ echo "$(dirname $(xcode-select -p))"/SharedFrameworks/LLDB.framework/Versions/A/Resources/Python > "$(echo python_env/lib/python*)/site-packages/lldb.pth"
```

We can now `import pydevd` and `import lldb`! Go to the `test_loop` function and rewrite it to:

```python
import os
import sys
sys.path.append('/Applications/PyCharm CE.app/Contents/plugins/python-ce/helpers/pydev')
from lldb import SBDebugger, SBCommandReturnObject  
from pydevd import settrace  
  
def test_loop(  
    debugger: SBDebugger,  
    command: str,  
    result: SBCommandReturnObject,  
    dict  
):  
    settrace()  
    print(command)  
    print(debugger.GetSelectedTarget())  
    result.AppendWarning(f'Warning from {test_loop.__name__}')  
    print('')
```

To attach to this script, do the following steps:
1. Launch `lldb`
2. Attach PyCharm to the `lldb` process
3. Call the command from `lldb`, and PyCharm will break after the `settrace()` function

This is what it should look like:

With the might of PyCharm in our hands, let's slap together some useful scripts. 

How about [this one](https://gist.github.com/abdulowork/98ee0d9170e949488c508390ce81cb4f) for automating the [Finder hack](https://abdulowork.github.io/Hacking-Finder-with-lldb-and-Hopper/)?

In addition to commands, it is also possible to script breakpoints. Let's [dump an image](https://gist.github.com/abdulowork/d61303baf22b6d0feb469f12f949b1f9) of a view any time `viewDidAppear` is called by reading a pointer from the Objective-C method and generating a Swift expression using Python.
